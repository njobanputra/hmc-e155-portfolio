## Lab 1: FPGA and MCU Setup and Testing

# Introduction
In this lab I created code, and testbenches to control a 7-segment display. A user can use the 4 DIP switches to control the 7 segment display to show 0-F on the hexidecimal scale.

# Technical Documentation
The source code for this project can be found in this github repository.

### Block Diagram

The block diagram in @fig-block-diagram demonstrates the overall architecture of the design.
The top-level module `top` includes 4 submodules: the high-speed oscillator block (`hf_osc`), the led2 module, the led1 module, the led0 module and the seven segment display module.

### Finding Resistor Values

@fig-schematic shows the physical layout of the design.
The FPGA pins are connected to a resistor before entering into the seven segment display to ensure that the LED doesn't recieve too much current and thus burns out. For the seven segment display I used 1k$\Omega$ resistors on each segment (see math below).

For the LEDs I used about 220\Omega$ because that is a reasonable amount for a red LED.

## Results and Discussion
I tested the circuit and I was able to get all the segments to light up and control them through the dip switches. Additonally, the LEDs also worked as planned. However, not all of my segments are light to the same amount of brightness. I don't know why since they all recieved the same resistor value. If I have time I will continue to debug.

I think I spent a total of 25-27 hours on this lab. I ran into major issues with programming the FPGA which ended up gating me for about 4 days.
