## Lab 5: Interrupts

# Introduction
In this lab I created code, and testbenches to control a 7-segment display. A user can use the 4 DIP switches to control the 7 segment display to show 0-F on the hexidecimal scale.

# Technical Documentation
The source code for this project can be found in this [github repository](https://github.com/njobanputra/e155_lab05).

## Results and Discussion
I validated the velocity I got from my program by both counting it and taking an oscilliscope trace and doing some math. I set my motor to about 11.33V and my program showed a velocity of about 2.72 revs/second. I started a timer for about 15 seconds and counted the amount of revolutions I saw. Then I scaled that number down for 1 second which is the velocity my program was outputting. I ended up getting a velocity of about 2.667 revs/second. For the math way I started by taking an oscilscope trace.

@fig-oscopetrace shows the interrupt signals.

From the oscilloscope I measured that the frequency was 1.1KHz. Below shows my math to validte the speed through manual hand calculations.
